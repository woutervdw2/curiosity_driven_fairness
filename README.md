For this thesis the ml-fairness-gym repository is used as a building block for the simulations. This readme serves as a guide to find the code that trains, evaluates and visualizes the agents and results as described in the paper. Most of the added code is found in the curiosity folder, here you can find code to train, test, evaluate and plot the results of the agents. The implementation of the UCB, visit-count and scalar rewards can be found in the rewards.py file. The visualisations of the results can be either found in the models folder, each agent has its own visualisations of their test results, or in the (final)plots folder where the plots of the final evaluations can be found. The fairness results can be found in the fairness folder. In order to be able to apply and implement reinforcement learning agents in the environments a few changes have been made to these environments and to the run_util file. In the agent folder there is added a RL agent which serves as base class for all the RL agents applied in the simulations.
